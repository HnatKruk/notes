# NOTES
NOTES is my personal pet project designed to practice, improve and demonstrate my web development skills. This project was based on the notes application from Apple. I decided to try to repeat this project on my own, which was a kind of challenge to myself.
The main goal of this project is to improve and develop skills in web development and gain experience using many different technologies. Using state managers, connecting and configuring tests, and using new development approaches gave me a lot of experience and knowledge.
I believe that every stage of this project contributes to my professional growth, and I am open to feedback and improvements. This is another step towards development and self-improvement.

The project is also available online. You can check it out at this link: <a href="https://hnatkruk.github.io/notes/" target="_blank">NOTES</a>
